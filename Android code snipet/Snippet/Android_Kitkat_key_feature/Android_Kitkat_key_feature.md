## Tools for Analyzing Memory Use

```java
ActivityManager activityManager =
  (ActivityManager) getSystemService(ACTIVITY_SERVICE);

boolean lowRam = ActivityManager.isLowRamDevice();
if( lowRam ){
  //TODO Modify memory
}
```

## Transitions Framework

## Just say "OK Google"

> You don't need to touch the screen to get things done. When on your home screen or in Google Now, just say "OK Google" to launch voice search

## A smarter caller ID

> Whenever you get a call from a phone number not in your contacts, your phone will look for matches from businesses with a local listing on Google Maps.

## A work of art

> While listening to music on your device, or while projecting movies to Chromecast, you'll see beautiful _full-screen album and movie art when your device is locked._ You can play, pause or seek to a specific moment.

## A smarter caller ID

> Whenever you get a call from a phone number not in your contacts, your phone will look for matches from businesses with a local listing _on Google Maps_

## Full-screen Immersive Display

> Video, map, books and game â€“ now all of these take centre stage with the new _immersive mode_ which automatically hides everything except what you really want to see

```java
View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE
View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY //persistance
```

```java
mDecorView = getWindow().getDecorView();
```

```java
// This snippet hides the system bars.
private void hideSystemUI() {
    // Set the IMMERSIVE flag.
    // Set the content to appear under the system bars so that the content
    // doesn't resize when the system bars hide and show.
    mDecorView.setSystemUiVisibility(
            View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION // hide nav bar
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN // hide status bar
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE);
}

// This snippet shows the system bars. It does this by removing all the flags
// except for the ones that make the content appear under the system bars.
private void showSystemUI() {
    mDecorView.setSystemUiVisibility(
            View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN);
}
```

```java
@Override
public void onWindowFocusChanged(boolean hasFocus) {
        super.onWindowFocusChanged(hasFocus);
    if (hasFocus) {
        decorView.setSystemUiVisibility(
                View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE
                | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION
